# Element

## Definition

An element represents an individual component in templates. Unlike items, elements do not repeat on the same page as a list. They are used for standalone components that appear consistently across multiple templates.

If a component repeats across multiple templates, an element file can be created for it.

An example of an element component is a search bar for a specific page.

## Example

```html

--8<-- "docs/components/templates/element.html"

```
