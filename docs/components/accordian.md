# Accordian

## Definition

An accordion is a vertically stacked list of items that can be expanded or collapsed to reveal more content. Each item has a header that is always visible and a body that appears when the header is clicked.

Accordions help organize content, reduce scrolling, and present information in a manageable way. They can include icons, animations, and can be configured to allow multiple or single item expansion.

- Reduces vertical scrolling for easier navigation.
- Organizes content into sections for better readability.
- Allows users to focus on one section at a time.
