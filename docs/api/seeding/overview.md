# 🌱 Welcome to Your Django Seeding Toolkit!

### 🚀 Purpose: Make seeding fast, simple, and full of context!

Whether you're testing, demoing, or onboarding new developers — filling your database with realistic data shouldn't be a chore. This module is designed to help you **seed Django models quickly** using a smart combo of techniques:

---

## 🧠 How It Works

We combine different **data generators** to give you flexible and meaningful seed data:

| Type      | What It Does                                                            |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧪 `faker`     | Generates realistic fake data (names, dates, etc.)                 |
| 🤖 `llm`       | Uses large language models to generate rich text                  |
| 🧊 `static`    | Uses a fixed value for consistent results                          |
| 🔁 `callable`  | Runs a function to generate custom dynamic values                 |
| 🔧 `custom`    | Calls a reusable method defined in your seeding class             |

## ⚡ Fast Rebuilds with Caching

We store seed results in a local SQLite cache table — so if you’ve seeded once, you can rebuild your database instantly the next time. Perfect for:

- Rapid development
- Restoring known states
- Testing edge cases

---

## ✨ Why You'll Love It

- 🧠 **Context-aware** data for better realism
- ⏱️ **Cached results** = faster rebuilds
- 🧹 **Modular generators** let you mix faker, LLMs, and functions
